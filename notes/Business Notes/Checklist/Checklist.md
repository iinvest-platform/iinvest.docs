0. Viability [30 question](https://alltopstartups.com/2013/04/04/do-you-have-a-startup-idea-29-questions-to-determine-its-viability/)
1. Name & Legal Structure/Articles Of Incorporation
   1. Sole Propertorship
   2. Partnership
   3. Limited Liability Company
   4. Corporation or S-Corporation
2. Intellectual Property (IP) Assignment Agreement
3. Bylaws
   1. In order to ensure that a startup operates with as little complications as possible, founders should formulate strong bylaws off the bat. Bylaws should establish the internal rules of the company like how to settle disputes, select leadership and determine the rights and powers of shareholders. Most importantly, bylaws should institute voting thresholds for approvals to certain actions by the corporation like electing new board members or entering into debt.
4. Operating Agreement (Founder's Agreement)
   1. To avoid any conflict among founding parties, all co-founders should sign a comprehensive operating agreement. The agreement should define the relationship of the founders, provide the expectation that all work will belong to some entity in the future and outline a basic communication and conflict-resolution clause that can help prevent disputes
5. Business Plan
6. Register Company Website & Social Media Accounts
7. Define Co-founder Responsibilities (Paper)
8. Employee Contracts and Offer Letters
   1. Startup CEOs and founders should draw up clear employment contracts and offer letters when hiring new employees. These legal documents are key to ensure employees understand what’s expected of them. They should clearly state the following.
      1. Terms of employment (e.g., compensation, role responsibilities, working hours and grounds for termination)
      2. Reporting structure
      3. IP ownership of work
      4. Expectations
      5. Required commitments
      6. Share vesting
      7. Company policies (e.g., vacation days, paid time off structure, dress code)
9. Non-Diclosure Agreements
   1. Having a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) readily available is imperative before any business conversations take place between you and an outside party. From the moment a prospective employee or investor walks through your door, you need to have an NDA agreement waiting for them to sign. NDAs protect your startup by safeguarding your founder and employees’ ideas and your intellectual property. An NDA should specify the following:
      1. What constitutes confidential information
      2. How confidential information should be handled
      3. Who owns that information (the company)
      4. The time period that the information will be disclosed
      5. The time period confidentiality will be maintained
10. Federal Employer Identification number
   2. Apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) from the IRS. A FEIN will be necessary to open a bank account or process payroll.
11. Open Company Bank account
   3. Contact the bank prior to opening the account to see what their specific requirements are to open a business checking account; some banks’ requirements are fairly simple whereas some banks’ requirements are extremely complex
12. Business Licence
   4. Most Cities or Counties require you to obtain a business license, even if you operate a home-based business. This is a license granting the company the authority to do business in that city/county.
13. Shareholder Agreements
    1.  Finally, when a startup is ready to take on private investments, CEOs should create a shareholder agreement that determines the rights of shareholders and defines when they can exercise those rights. Those rights can include shareholders’ right to transfer shares, right of first refusal, redemption upon death or disability and shareholders’ power to manage and run the startup. It’s also important that founders document the sale of any shares to avoid huge financial penalties under state and federal laws
14.  Set up accounting & record-keeping System
   5. Company documents generally are required to be kept for 3 years, including: a list of all owners and addresses, copies of all formation documents, financial statements, annual reports, amendments or changes to the company. All Tax and Corporate Filings should be kept for at least 3 years.
15.  Business Insurance
16.  Systemize & Organize
   6. Prepare the business as if someone needed to take it over and run it for you. This means have a method to process orders, pay bills, pay employees, pay taxes, maintain your permits, etc. Basically, try to make the operational aspect of the business as automated and efficient as possible so you can concentrate on growing your business
17.  Develop Business Identity
   7. Order business cards, letterhead and promotional materials for your business. A professionally created logo can make your business look professional and established.
