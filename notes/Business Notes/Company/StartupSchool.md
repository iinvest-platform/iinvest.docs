### Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas
It is important to understand that a startup has to make things people will be willing to pay for.
Sometimes smart people have bad idead typically because it is the first thing/idea they think of. 
One must understand that it is important to take recule and really allocate time to consider the viability of
a potential idea. Because, big ideas arise from small ones. 
Hence, the main primary reason people who are really smart come up with rudimentary ideas is the following,
they come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point feel like so much work as been up in
that it is too late to pivot/change. To fix this, one must realize that having invested time into something
doesn't necessarily make it good. 

The second reason people often come up with bad ideas is primarily due to the fact that they aim to have one foot in
and one foot out. Meaning they aim to do something cool and maybe make some money while the real focus should indeed
be on doing something that will make substantial amounts of money and maybe will be cool. 
Thus, unless making money is your first priority, it likely won't happen at all.

The third mistake is being too timid. Remember, there's no such thing as business, there's selling, promotion,
figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying bills, getting clients to pay you,
getting incorporated, raising money, and so on. Don't be like a hyena who is usually content to survive on leftovers since
they are too afraid of lions except the lions.

#### Important Points
1. Ask yourself, will people pay for this? Is this, of all thing we could make, the thing people will pay for?
2. Reading the WSJ will provide anyone with 3-4 startup ideas since the problems portrayed are so well defined.
3. People are good at solving problems but bad at choosing the adequate problems to solve
4. The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out.
5. The essence of a startup is having brilliant people do work that is beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person
while startups win becasuse they take people so smart that would in a big company we doing 'research' and set them to work instead on 
problems of the most immediate and mundane sort.
6. Read the book __How To Win Friends And Influence People__ as it allows you to see things from other people's point of views instead of thinking only of
yourself.
7. An engineer who has learned what to make and not just how to make it is extraordinarily powerful.
8. Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, 
  see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. 
  It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."
9. It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings 
than by selling recordings. But the margins are greater on products. So during the Bubble a lot of companies 
used consulting to generate revenues they could attribute to the sale of products, because it made a better story for an IPO.
10. Dealers try to give each customer the impression that the stuff they're showing him is something special that only a few people have seen, 
  when in fact it may have been sitting in their racks for years while they tried to unload it on buyer after buyer.
11. You need to offer especially large rewards to get great people to do tedious work. That's why startups always pay equity rather than just salary
#### Things To Consider
1. A phenomenal idea is a solution for micro-payments (Newspapers would love this)

### How To Get Startup Ideas
The way to get a startup idea is not to try to think of ideas but to look
for problems, primarily problems you have yourself. The best startup ideas tend to have three things in common,
* They are something the founders want for themselves
* Something that they themselves can build
* Something that few other realize are worth doing

The reason why it is important to work on problems you have is to validate that the problem actually exists. 
When you launch a startup, there has to at least be some users who really need what you are making not just people who 
could see themselves using it one day but who want it urgently. Usually this initial gorup of users is small. Hence, a founder
typically has to compromise on the following, 
1. Build something a large number of people want a small amount
2. Build something a small number of people want a large amount
Always choose the second type because all good startup idead are of that type but not all good ideas of that type are startup ideas
Remember, either dig a hole that is broad but shallow, or one that is narrow but deep as hell. 
Another point to consider is that you dont need narrowness per se, it's typically depth that you need more. Narrowness is a byproduct of 
optimizing for depth and speed. 

The most important thing about understanding paths out of the initial niche small target audience us the fact that these are hard to see.
The way to realize this is to just be the sort of person who can see such paths. Additionally, it is important to live in the rapidly 
changing field because, people at the edge of an innovative and rapidly changing field live in the future. hence __live in the future, then build what's missing__.

If you look at successful founder and their ideas, its generally a result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Living in the future
prepares you to notice oppotunities certain experience represent. 

it's great to be an engineer and the target user because, the cycle of generating new version and testing them on users can happen inside your head.
Additionally, always think about what's missing. Although they will often times take some time to notice, it's extremely important to keep in the back of
one's mind. Try to turn off the filters that would usually prevent you from seeing such problems. For example, try to stop taking the world for granted and question
things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems 
are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around 
after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that? From this, coming up with the right startup idea should be pretty obviuos.

The best plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, 
but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.
Just as trying to think of startup ideas tend to produce bad ones, working on things that could dismissed as toys often produces good ones. When something is seen as a toy,
it has everything an idea needs except being important. 

"Live In The Future And Build What Seems Interesting"

Because a good idea would seem obvious, when you have one, you'll tend to feel you're too late. That should never be a deterant. Worrying that you are late is a sign of a great idea.
It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. If you are uncertain, ask users. The question wether you're too late is 
subsumed by the question wether anyone needs what you plan to make. Err on doing things that you'll face competitors because your success depends more on you than your competitors. Better a 
good idea with competitors than a bad one without. You don't need to worry about enterring a crowded market so long as you have an idead about what everyone else is overlooking. A crowded market is
indeed a good sign because it mean that there indeed is a demand and that none of the existing solution are good enough. 
Any successful startup would have one of the following,
1. Be entering a market with existing competitors but armed with some secret weapon that will get them a large amount of users
2. Entering a market that looks small but will turn out to be quite big

The are a few more filters that have to be turned off as well. The unsexy filter and the schlep filter. The unsexy filter deals more with 
an idead being not "cool" enough. The Schlep filter deals with people wanting to be unbothered with some tedious thing. 

#### Tips & Tricks For Startup Ideas 
Organic ideas feel like an inspiration. 
1. Look for ideas in areas you have some expertise in. 
2. The place to start looking for ideas is things you need.
3. "Why doesn't someone make x" "If Someone made x, we'd buy it in a second"
4. Is there somthing unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people's
5. Did you discover any needs working on prior ideas
6. Are there things you and your friends would like to do that current tech. wont let you do
7. Talk to others about the gaps they find in the world. What's missing? What would they like to do, that they currently can't. 
What's tedious or annoying in their work? 
8. Make other people's problems your own. 
9. What do you wish someone would build that you would use. What would you pay for right now?
10. Look at industries and companies on the demise and try to capitalize. Thing of the following, "x company replaced the dying journalism industry"
11. Serve a need that big players may be ignoring.
12. Look for waves an ask how you could benefit from them. 
#### Key Takeaway
1. Live in the future and buld what's interesting
2. There is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas since when people make up startup ideas, they tend to think of the same ones.
3. Focus on users and not competitors since the most important information about competitors is what you lear via users anyway
4. Before building, try tp go sell a product and see if anyone would use it
#### Things To Consider
1. Always ask yourself the following, who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when its a crappy version
made by a 2 person startup they have never heard of?

### Want To Start A Startup
People tend to overvalue ideas. Startup ideas are not million dollar ideas. To see this, try to sell an idea.
What you would come to quickly realize is that there's no market fro startup ideas which suggests there's no demand. 
Meaning, in the narrow sense of the world, startup ideas are worthless. 

Most startups end up nothing like the initial idea. In the process of evaluating your initial idea, you will soon come to 
realize that it is broken. Instead of saying your idead is to make a collaborative, web base spreadsheet, say instead, could one make a web-based spreadsheet
that is inherently collaborative? A few tweaks and an incomplete idea becomes a promising question to explore. Or say let's try building a web based spreadsheet and
see how far we get. Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right
but if its a question, it can be wrong so long as its wrong in the way that lead to more ideas. 

Hence, to conclude on the first point, think of a mistaken question. 

To think of mistaken questions, you have to be familiar with promissing new technologies and have the right kinds of friends. New tech are the ingredients startup ideas
are made of and the various conversations with friends are the kitchens they're cooked in. 

Hence, to conclude on the second point, you have to expose yourself to cutting and new technologies while also openly discussing your ideas with like minded individuals.

It is important to doodle or better said to let your mind wander when thinking of problems. Start with a problem and then let your mind wander far enough for new ideas to form.
finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.
Additionally, redefining a problem as a superset of the current one is pretty ideal.

Take a luxury and make it a commodity. People must want something if they pay a lot for it. To make something cheaper, you have to redefine the problem. 
Making things cheaper is a subset of making things easier. 

So if you want to start a startup, you can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, and assume you could build something way easier to use.

It is important to create an idea/solution optimally designed for exit. f 98% of the time you're doing product development on spec for some big company, why not think of that as your task? 
One advantage of this approach is that it gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, think what they should be doing, and do it yourself. Even if they already know it, you'll probably be done faster.
