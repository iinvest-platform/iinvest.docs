## Who We Are
iinvest is a technological platform founded on the belief that a future where investing is simplified is
fundamentally more exciting than one where it isn’t. We are attempting to provide a consolidated socially
interactive privacy focused financial platform to serve as a one stop shop for one’s financial needs.
We recognize that the most robust solution to the modern investment problem is a sleek distributed
network providing users with attractive learning resources, up to date and credible market news,
simplified market summaries, a focalized financial research environment, and the ability to leverage
your network as you make financial decisions. As the saying “think outside the box” goes, we decided
to construct this unorthodox solution in hopes of disentangling the various complexities associated with
finance, hence, simplifying the time-intensive effort attributed to consuming compacted market data on
the behalf of our users, and creating a future comprised of more financially adept individuals.

## Technical Solution
The iinvest application will be comprised of a multitude of backend microservice.
The primary application and benefit of such an implementation pattern
is the enforcement of loose coupling of service logic and well as technical organizational independence.

The backend architecture will be comprised of various __go__ and __java__ microservices.
These will allow for a highly performant backend system able to serve the required business use cases and the proposed problem.
For truly computing intensive low latency use cases, __C++__ will also be utilized.
__Java__ will be applied for big data processing based services as well as services implementing streaming.
Additionally, the proposed recommendation service will be implemented in __Java__ or __python__.
